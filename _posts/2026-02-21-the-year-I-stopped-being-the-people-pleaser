> Lately, I've been listening to a lot of music on TIDAL. It's become background noise for long drives, late-night thinking, and the quiet moments in between conversations that didn't sit right. And if I opened the "My Most Listened" playlist that TIDAL created for me right now, the very first song on that list would be *"People Pleaser"* by :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
>
> That doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is how long I've lived inside that label.
>
> I’ve felt like a people pleaser for so long that it stopped feeling like a choice and started feeling like a personality trait. I was the one who said yes. The one who kept the peace. The one who explained things away so no one had to feel uncomfortable. I told myself it was kindness. I told myself it was maturity. I told myself I was just being understanding.
>
> What I didn't admit was that I was afraid.
>
> Afraid of someone being mad at me. Afraid of disappointing people. Afraid of being misunderstood. Afraid that if I held a boundary too firmly, I would be labeled difficult instead of honest.
>
> So I said yes to things that didn’t fit anymore. I stayed in conversations longer than I should have. I tolerated dynamics that quietly chipped away at me because I didn’t want to be the one who “made it worse.” I convinced myself that keeping everyone else regulated was more important than listening to the part of me that was tightening in my chest.
>
> This year, something shifted.
>
> I realized that healing isn't just journaling about your wounds. It's not reading the right books or saying the right words. Healing, for me, meant dropping the label of "people pleaser" and examining why I wore it so proudly in the first place.
>
> It meant noticing how often I was performing calm while internally negotiating my own discomfort. It meant acknowledging that every time I chose harmony over honesty, I was quietly betraying myself.
>
> And here’s the part no one romanticizes: being a people pleaser doesn’t just hurt you in theory. It hurts you in real time.
>
> You say yes when you mean no.
> You smile when you feel resentment building.
> You explain yourself until you're exhausted.
> You become hyper-aware of everyone else's moods and completely disconnected from your own.
>
> And the person who absorbs the cost of that pattern isn't "everyone." It's you.
>
> I used to think being agreeable meant being good. I thought being flexible meant being loving. I thought that if I could just keep the peace long enough, everything would stabilize.
>
> But peace that depends on your silence isn't peace. It's self-erasure.
>
> Letting go of the people pleaser identity has not made me colder. It hasn’t made me cruel. It hasn’t turned me into someone who doesn’t care. What it has done is clarify where I end and someone else begins. It has forced me to sit with the discomfort of someone being unhappy with me — and realizing that their unhappiness does not automatically mean I did something wrong.
>
> For a long time, I believed my role was to make sure everyone around me felt okay.
>
> Now I understand that my responsibility is to make sure I’m not abandoning myself in the process.
>
> There is nothing noble about constantly shrinking so others can stay comfortable. There is nothing mature about swallowing your needs to avoid conflict. And there is nothing selfish about deciding that your peace matters, too.
>
> If *“People Pleaser”* is the most played song on my playlist, it’s not because I’m proud of that label. It’s because I’m in the middle of shedding it.
>
> And if I’m honest, that shedding feels less like rebellion and more like alignment.
>
> I’m not trying to be difficult. I’m not trying to be hard. I’m not trying to “win.”
>
> I'm just done hurting myself to make everyone else comfortable.
