**Hook (1-2 paragraphs):** set the emotional tone without rushing.

**The truth:** what happened / what you realized

**The pattern:** what you noticed repeating (in people, in yourself, in the world).

**The boundary / lesson:** what you're choosing now.

**Closing:** something grounded - not a cliché, not a speech.
