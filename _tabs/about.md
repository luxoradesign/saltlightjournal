SaltlightJournal began as a place to write what I could no longer keep in my head. Not perfectly. Not performatively. Just honestly.

I have spent years learning that clarity rarely arrives all at once. It arrives in fragments - after conversations that didn't sit right, after relationships that changed shape, after grief that didn't move on schedule. This journal exists to document that process in real time. Not as a polished afterthought, but as a record of becoming.

The writing here moves through relationships, power, boundaries, motherhood, grief, rebuilding, and the quiet recalibration that happens when you stop lying to yourself about what hurts. Some essays will feel reflective. Some will feel sharp. All of them are written with the intention of staying grounded instead of reactive.

This is not a lifestyle blog and it is not a manifesto. It is a working archive of growth. A place where I examine what I’ve learned, what I’m unlearning, and what still feels unresolved. I am less interested in being agreeable than I am in being accurate.

SaltlightJournal is written and edited by Acacia Banting. Over time, I hope the work here will expand beyond this site — into essays, publications, and projects that carry the same tone: calm, honest, and unwilling to dilute itself for comfort.

If you are rebuilding something - your life, your voice, your boundaries - you are welcome here. Not because I have answers, but because I am committed to asking better questions.
